# HR-estimate-based-on-the-Thermal-Imaging

Absolutely, here's the revised version with more smileys for your README file:

This project focuses on estimating Heart Rate (HR) and Breathing Rate (BR) through thermal imaging of the face. It's implemented in MATLAB and comprises three files:

1. **temperature_signal_extraction.m**: Processes thermal imaging videos, extracts Regions of Interest (ROIs), employs Harris feature extraction for frame overlap, enhances algorithm stability, converts pixel values to temperature values, and extracts raw signals. ðŸ˜Ž

2. **signal_processing.m**: Filters the average temperature signal and calculates HR and BR. ðŸ˜Š

3. **bland_altman.m**: Presents results and compares estimated values to real values. ðŸ“Š

This project marked one of my initial endeavors during my 3rd year of Bachelor's, and while not highly advanced, it still holds practical value. ðŸ’¡
